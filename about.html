            champions the freedom of thinking. It has established a formidable reputation since its inception in 2003.
            The university rises to one of the first ranking private universities because of its sound physical
            facilities, outstanding teaching and the commitment to the future generation. The exception of BUBT lies in
            the fact that all the members of the Trustee Board are, educationists, professors and entrepreneurs of
            education. With the advent of their leadership the university is rapidly climbing to a place that observes a
            unique position of international standard.<br><br>

            The vision of the university is to get the reputation of a world class university with a dynamic approach to
            enable the students to create their place in the world. With this aim the university has been advancing with

            campus of BUBT has been located at Rupnagar, Mirpur, whereas the other campus is also in Mirpur, adjacent to
            Dhaka Commerce College. The outstanding achievement of BUBT in the very first decade has been to remain
            student focused. The number of the student enrollment is envious and it exceeds 10 thousand in the month of
            October 2017. However BUBT never compromises with the quality, professionalism and sustainability. The
            university believes in the motto “committed to academic excellence”--- a slogan that thrives the spirit of
            everyone.<br><br>

            “The realistic and quality education that BUBT provides is time befitting to create skilled manpower for the
            competitive world.” In an extensive interview with this magazine, the Convainor of Academic Advisory
            Committee and Member of BUBT Trust Dr. Shafiq Ahmed Siddique said, “It’s a matter of hope that the nation is
            thriving for change.” “I have spent my entire life in teaching and now I wonder that people, irrespective of
            rich and poor are enthusiastically spending money after education now a days. This shows the beacon of the
            day, the enlightening future of a nation”, he added. He emphasized on its educational strategies, saying,
